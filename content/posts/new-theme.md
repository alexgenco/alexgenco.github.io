Another short post to say that I haven't forgotten about this blog yet! I spent a long time breaking one of my [previously stated blog rules](/posts/hello-world/#learn-no-new-tools) and rewriting the theme from scratch. It is basically the same color palette and layout as before, but the HTML and CSS are all new. I learned a lot about HTML semantic elements and CSS flexboxes to make this happen. Although it's probably far from perfect, I'm very proud of myself for finishing the rewrite, because I've tried this exact thing before and given up in the middle. I guess this was just bite-size enough for me to pull it off.

I'm still mulling over my next actual post, so stay tuned.
