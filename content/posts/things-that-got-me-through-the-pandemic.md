According to Joey Biden's State of the Union, we are officially done with the COVID pandemic. To boot, I am recovering from the worst cold I've had since I was in like, second grade (I got it from my nasty little nephew). All that has got me reflecting on the pandemic, and I've been surprised by how many _good_ memories I have from that time. I thought I would document some of these.

## Animal Crossing: New Horizons

Yeah that's right, first and foremost is VIDEO GAME.

This game came out March 20, 2020, which was just 3 days after San Francisco issued its official Shelter in Place order. It was just starting to dawn on everyone just how long this thing could last, and we were coming to terms with the impact it would have on our social lives (yes, even me).

Then along came this video game that _simulated an active and healthy social life_. The timing could not have been more perfect. If Nintendo had known about the COVID-19 pandemic ahead of time, they probably would have picked the same release date for this game.

My wife and I played this game every day. It marked the transition between work and home. We would divvy up chores, share screenshots of our interior decorations, gossip about other villagers, plan our next projects, etc. We also had an active group text with my sister and her husband, who had their own island that we would sometimes visit. It gave us something to talk about when there was otherwise not that much to talk about, at a time when we desperately needed something _else_ to talk about!

I can't stress enough how much this game shaped our lockdown experience. I miss it terribly sometimes.
