Last year was a big movie year for us. We got season passes to the Alamo Drafthouse right down the street, so we've been trying to go at least a couple times a month to get our money's worth. But often I'll go much more often than that... On average, I'm probably closer to 1-2 movies a _week_.

I'll try not to spoil anything, even though the only person who reads this is my wife and she saw all of these with me.

Also, these won't be in any order, and I probably won't be able to pick a favorite. This isn't a listicle, it's a _sophisticated_, _nuanced_ publication with _standards_.

## The Banshees of Inisherin

Just kidding, this was my favorite movie of 2022.

If you know me, you know this is my favorite type of movie. It's slow and quiet but the characters are freaking _intense_. I still get goosebumps whenever I see a clip of Barry Keoghan's performance.

I also watched McDonagh's "In Bruges" for the first time before watching this. It's a nice companion movie if you're into the Collin Firth - Brendan Gleeson chemistry.

## Everything Everywhere All At Once

Possibly the opposite movie of "Banshees"? This one felt like 6 movies playing on top of each other. We watched it a second time with my father-in-law and he was losing his mind for the first hour and then fell asleep. Great film.

## Fire of Love

This is a good one to snuggle up and get real _sleepy_ to. I think there was only one other person at the theater when my wife and I saw this. Extremely meditative, beautiful, haunting. The volcano footage is absolutely unreal.

## Marcel the Shell with Shoes On

I didn't see this movie. I just wanted to bring it up because the trailer made me nauseous and that seems notable.

## The Northman

I don't listen to Metal, but this movie made me want to.

## Decision to Leave

A murder mystery that cooks frfr
