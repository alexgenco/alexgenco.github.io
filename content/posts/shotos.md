There's a little bit of debate about the definition of "Shotos", but for the purposes of this post (and I'd argue in general when talking about Smash Bros. Ultimate), it refers to Ryu and Ken. Here are some huge pictures of them that I don't want to learn how to resize:

## Normal Canceling

This is the main concept that differentiates Shotos (well, and Terry) from other fighters. I've seen it referred to as "Special Canceling" as well. The simplest way I can think of to explain it is "chaining moves together". However, there are a couple concepts that I need to explain first before I can really get into the details.

### Attack Animation

When a character performs an attack there are 3 basic stages to the animation:

- **Startup** is the animation that happens before the attack can do any damage. Think of the Falcon Punch, while he's saying _"Falcon..."_.
- **Active frames** are the parts of the animation during which you can inflict damage on an opponent. During these animations, the character exposes _hit boxes_, which are the areas that cause damage when they overlap with an opponent's _hurt boxes_. Think of the _"PUNCH"_ part of the Falcon Punch, where the hit boxes are around his fist and the hurt boxes are Mario's friggin' face or whatever.
- **Cooldown** is the period after the active frames have ended, but before you can control your character again. Think of all the time your opponent has to _body_ you after your corny-ass Falcon Punch misses.

### Normals and Specials

I think this concept originates from Street Fighter itself. I don't play Street Fighter (at least, not as much as I play Smash), so I'm probably going to get some of this wrong.

- **Normals** are the basic moves that come out when you hit a button, i.e. "punch" and "kick", and their weak/medium/strong variations.
- **Specials** are the moves that require a combination of buttons, e.g. the famous "Hadoken", which is performed with the inputs ↓ → + punch.

In Smash Bros., this translates roughly to "Normals" = "A moves", and "Specials" = "B moves". However, you can also perform specials using the original Street Fighter inputs for a little extra damage. This is typically how advanced Shoto players perform them.

Another thing I should mention is that shotos have certain _variations_ on their moves that other characters don't have:

- Weak/medium/heavy is determined by how _long_ you hold the button. Weak is the shortest and does the least damage, heavy is the longest and does the most. Typically only specials have medium versions, while normals only have weak and heavy.
- Near/far is determined by your distance to the opponent when you perform it. These are typically entirely different moves, despite having the same inputs.

### The Rules of Normal Canceling

For most characters, there is no way to skip the cooldown animation unless an opponent hits you out of it. Shotos, however, can use normal canceling to skip the cooldown animation and immediately perform a follow-up attack. But they can't just cancel every cooldown animation willy-nilly. Here are some rules:

- Only certain moves can be canceled, and only by certain other moves. In general, only normals can be canceled, and only by specials.
- You can only cancel a normal move if it "lands", that is, if its hit-boxes collide with a hurt-box. This can be another character, their shield, or any active item such as a projectile.
- You only have until the end of the active frames to input the next move, after which the input will be ignored.

There are of course some exceptions to these rules, mostly around down-smash:

- Down-smash counts as a "normal" move for the purposes of normal canceling.
- Down-smash can be canceled _while it's still charging_, that is, before any active frames have come out. Once you let go of the charge though, it follows the normal rules of requiring a hurt-box collision to be canceled.

I may have missed some rules/exceptions, but that's enough to get the basic idea.

If performed correctly, you will skip the cooldown animation and immediately perform the special move. As you can imagine, this is an excellent way to land combos and deal a lot of damage.

## Applications

At this point, you can basically mix-and-match your normals and your specials into infinite combinations. Here are some of the most common (when facing right):

- Jab (heavy+close) -> Shoryuken (→ ↓ ↘ + A/B)
- Down-tilt (heavy) -> Hadoken (↓ → + A/B)
- Down-tilt (light or heavy) -> Tatsumaki Senpukyaku (↓ ← + A/B)

Turns out it's harder than I was hoping to find short GIFs of these combos, so you'll just have to use your imagination I guess. Or maybe I'll make them myself (unlikely).
