Here are some things I&rsquo;d like to write about:</p><h3 id=learning-guitar>Learning Guitar</h3><p>I&rsquo;ve been teaching myself &ldquo;finger-style&rdquo; guitar. I put it in quotes because it&rsquo;s possible nobody who actually knows how to do it calls it that. But that&rsquo;s what I call it because you use your fingers, not a pick. Here are some songs that I&rsquo;ve been learning:</p><ul><li>Don&rsquo;t Think Twice, It&rsquo;s Alright - Bob Dylan</li><li>Eugene - Sufjan Stevens</li><li>Carrie & Lowell - Sufjan Stevens</li><li>The Wind - Cat Stevens</li><li>Hearts and Bones - Paul Simon</li><li>You Needed Love, I Needed You - Angelo De Augustine</li></ul><p>Some of these I know front-to-back, others just a few parts. I&rsquo;d like to set a goal for number of songs learned front-to-back by the end of 2023. I&rsquo;m thinking a dozen is a good number, because I learned maybe 4 in 2022 and I think I could put in roughly 3x more work.</p><h3 id=software-development>Software Development</h3><p>Maybe, I dunno. I spend all day writing software so I might not be trying to sit down and write ABOUT software once I&rsquo;m done.</p><h3 id=video-games>Video games</h3><p>I play kind of a lot of video games. Well actually, I play relatively few video games, but I put a lot of time into those few. Right now the big ones are Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Slay the Spire.</p><p>Smash: I don&rsquo;t really have a venue to play real people (playing online is too frustrating, and I don&rsquo;t go to locals), but I enjoy playing CPUs. I&rsquo;ve specifically focused a lot on Shotos (Ken/Ryu), so maybe I&rsquo;ll write about some of their more advanced techniques.</p><p>Slay: I&rsquo;ve gotten Ascension level 20 on all characters (effectively, beaten the game 100%). I actually don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d write about this game, other than maybe re-post some good memes from /r/slaythespire.</p><h3 id=movies>Movies</h3><p>We got a season pass to Alamo Drafthouse, so my wife and I have been watching a lot of these things.</p><h3 id=speedrunning>Speedrunning</h3><p>I&rsquo;ve been following a small community of adventure game speedrunners who play all my old favorite point-and-click adventure games. I don&rsquo;t really participate (although I practiced the Monkey Island 2 speedrun long enough to place 8th on the leaderboard, which has since dropped to 10th), but I watch enough to know a little bit about the techniques they use. Also some of the glitches/exploits they use are really funny to me, so I might just post some of those.</p><h3 id=others>Others</h3><p>I do other things I think&mldr; maybe I&rsquo;ll remember what they are and blog about them.</p><h2 id=blog-rules>Blog rules</h2><p>I need to set some expectations here to give myself the best chance of succeeding.</p><h3 id=minimal-editing>Minimal editing</h3><p>If perfection is the goal, I will never finish even a single post. I&rsquo;m already failing a little bit at this one.</p><h3 id=keep-it-short>Keep it short</h3><p>The bar needs to be so low that even &ldquo;Not today&rdquo; counts as a post.</p><h3 id=learn-no-new-tools>Learn no new tools</h3><p>This includes things like CSS/HTML/JS and even more advanced usage of Hugo (the blog framework I&rsquo;m using to write this). I&rsquo;m inexperienced with these things, but I know enough to get prohibitively bogged down with the details. Can&rsquo;t happen here or I have no chance. I will maybe change the background color, but that&rsquo;s it.</p><p>I guess that&rsquo;s all for now. Until next time!</p><a href=/>>> Home</a></main></div><footer><script>(function(){function n(e){var t,n,o,s=document.getElementsByTagName(e);for(n=0;n<s.length;n++)if(o=s[n],t=o.parentElement,t.childNodes.length===1){if(t.nodeName==="A"&&(t=t.parentElement,t.childNodes.length!=1))continue;t.nodeName==="P"&&(t.style.textAlign="center")}}for(var t=["img","embed","object"],e=0;e<t.length;e++)n(t[e])})()</script></footer></body></html>
