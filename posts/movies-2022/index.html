We got season passes to the Alamo Drafthouse right down the street, so we&rsquo;ve been trying to go at least a couple times a month to get our money&rsquo;s worth. But I&rsquo;ll typically go more often than that&mldr; probably closer to 1-2 movies a week.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll try not to spoil anything, even though the only person who reads this is my wife and she saw all of these with me.</p><p>Also, these won&rsquo;t be in any order, and I probably won&rsquo;t be able to pick a favorite. This isn&rsquo;t a listicle, it&rsquo;s a <em>sophisticated</em>, <em>nuanced</em> publication with <em>standards</em>.</p><h2 id=the-banshees-of-inisherin>The Banshees of Inisherin</h2><p>Just kidding, this was my favorite movie of 2022.</p><p>If you know me, you know this is my favorite type of movie. It&rsquo;s slow and quiet but the characters are freaking <em>intense</em>. I still get goosebumps whenever I see clips of Barry Keoghan&rsquo;s performance.</p><blockquote class=twitter-tweet data-dnt=true data-align=center><p lang=en dir=ltr>Every time this kid shows up in a movie buckle tf up <a href=https://t.co/HZ2XW6q9gU>pic.twitter.com/HZ2XW6q9gU</a></p>&mdash; ⛓⛓ (@marksnotnice) <a href="https://twitter.com/marksnotnice/status/1421582555900481537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script><p>I also watched McDonagh&rsquo;s &ldquo;In Bruges&rdquo; for the first time before watching this. It&rsquo;s a nice companion movie if you&rsquo;re into McDonagh&rsquo;s dark humor and the Collin Firth - Brendan Gleeson chemistry.</p><h2 id=memoria>Memoria</h2><p>Speaking of quietly intense! This one <em>cooks</em>. It&rsquo;s sooo slow&mldr; I could almost hear the actors like, counting to 30 before saying the next line. In one scene, you literally watch a dude take a nap.</p><p><strong>slight spoiler</strong></p><p>And also, it had one of my favorite things in movies (or pretty much any narrative art), which is hard for me to explain, but basically when they drop a tiny morsel (the tinier the better) that suggests the plot was operating at an entirely different layer than you thought (often other-worldly/supernatural). I love this because you could turn around and watch the movie again and it feels like a completely different movie now that you <em>know</em>.</p><p><strong>end spoiler</strong></p><p>I&rsquo;m glad I caught this one because I learned afterwards that it&rsquo;s deliberately never going to be released on streaming services. I&rsquo;d love a re-watch if it&rsquo;s ever showing again, but for now I&rsquo;m just gonna have to let it stew.</p><h2 id=everything-everywhere-all-at-once>Everything Everywhere All At Once</h2><p>What&rsquo;s the opposite of &ldquo;quietly intense&rdquo;? This one felt like 6 movies playing on top of each other. We watched it a second time with my father-in-law and he was losing his mind for the first hour and then fell asleep. Great film.</p><h2 id=fire-of-love>Fire of Love</h2><p>This is a good one to snuggle up and get real <em>sleepy</em> to. I think there was only one other person at the theater when my wife and I saw this. Extremely meditative, beautiful, haunting. The volcano footage is absolutely unreal. And the whole thing feels like watching ghosts, because you KNOW these folks died doing this (and it&rsquo;s in the movie&rsquo;s description, so not a spoiler).</p><h2 id=nope>Nope</h2><p>I saw this twice and loved it twice. This is probably my favorite movie moment of 2022 (I&rsquo;m not going to learn how to make this a normal size):</p><iframe src=https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/irFbw7-ox7o title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><strong>slight spoiler</strong></p><p>I haven&rsquo;t seen many Alien movies, but IMO this one has the best alien reveal since Signs. They just give you little snippets until you think you&rsquo;re never going to see it and then BAM. This one&rsquo;s a little different though, for reasons that go beyond &ldquo;slight&rdquo; spoiler territory.</p><p><strong>end spoiler</strong></p><p>Anyway, go see it.</p><h2 id=marcel-the-shell-with-shoes-on>Marcel the Shell with Shoes On</h2><p>I didn&rsquo;t see this movie. I just wanted to bring it up because the trailer made me nauseous. I think the voice is like, too small if that makes sense?</p><h2 id=etc>etc.</h2><p>I saw a lot of other movies, but I&rsquo;m not sure I like this 1-2 paragraph summary format that I&rsquo;m cultivating here. Maybe I&rsquo;ll stick to single-movie reviews from now on.</p><hr><p>And with that, I&rsquo;ve finished my January blogging challenge! But I already feel like I want to write more, it&rsquo;s a little bit addicting.</p><p>Quick s/o to my wife (borat voice) for encouraging me to give this a shot, I think it&rsquo;s already paying off. Here&rsquo;s her much more interesting blog: <a href=https://fliptherecord.blog/>https://fliptherecord.blog/</a></p><p>Bye</p><a href=/>home</a>
