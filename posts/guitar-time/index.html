I have been really enjoying practicing guitar lately, so I will write about that.</p><h2 id=the-guitar>The Guitar</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve had a Martin Dreadnought body acoustic since high school that I think is a lovely guitar, but on a recent trip to my wife&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; house I tried out her old classical acoustic that she learned on in high school and loved it. I honestly don&rsquo;t even know what brand it is&mldr; it says &ldquo;Signature Series&rdquo;, model no. &ldquo;C2&rdquo;, &ldquo;Designed by Greg Bennett&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Made in Indonesia.&rdquo; The intonation isn&rsquo;t great, especially as you get higher on the fretboard, but when it&rsquo;s in tune I think it sounds really neat. Also the nylon strings are much more pleasant on my fingers than the metal treble strings. So now I practice on it almost exclusively.</p><h2 id=the-songs>The Songs</h2><p>The first song I started learning was &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Think Twice, It&rsquo;s Alright&rdquo; by Bob Dylan. I didn&rsquo;t really know anything about that play style (I guess it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Travis Picking&rdquo;), but it just seemed like a fun song to be able to sit down and play. Travis picking is also ubiquitous in acoustic guitar music, so I figured it would unlock a lot of other songs. And it did! I dunno I don&rsquo;t really feel like writing more about it, you all know this song.</p><p>The next song I learned was &ldquo;Eugene&rdquo; by Sufjan Stevens off of &ldquo;Carrie & Lowell&rdquo;. Like much of this album, this song is a haunting reflection on Sufjan&rsquo;s childhood, relationship with his parents, and mother&rsquo;s death. Absolutely devastating song to listen to over and over again, but that&rsquo;s what I did! The progression is fairly straightforward, but for a beginner like me it was pretty difficult physically. The main left hand shape involves index, ring, and pinky in sort of a claw shape while leaving the G string between ring and pinky open (3 5 0 5). This same shape moves up and down the fretboard throughout the song. This is difficult for me for a few reasons:</p><ul><li>It&rsquo;s hard to get my pinky to land on the right string. It tends to fly off on its own whenever I shift positions, and ends up landing in the wrong place when I try to put it back.</li><li>My ring finger constantly mutes the open string.</li><li>Whenever I slide to the next position, the squeaky string sounds seem too loud, and often I leave a ringing string behind as well. I think maybe I push down too hard on the strings or something.</li></ul><p>This song is gorgeous though, and I feel like I still get a lot of mileage out of practicing it because it touches a lot of fundamentals.</p><p>After these two songs it was off to the races. I started learning a couple others off of &ldquo;Carrie & Lowell&rdquo; (title track, &ldquo;Death with Dignity&rdquo;), and some songs from Sufjan&rsquo;s recent collaborator Angelo De Augustine (&ldquo;You Needed Love, I Needed You&rdquo;, &ldquo;Blue&rdquo;). Then I branched off into another Stevens (Cat) and leared &ldquo;The Wind&rdquo;, which is a totally different finger pattern. Oh, side-note: I was inspired to learn &ldquo;The Wind&rdquo; because of the show &ldquo;1899&rdquo;, which is a great show you should watch if you liked &ldquo;Dark&rdquo;. Now I&rsquo;m focusing on &ldquo;Hearts and Bones&rdquo; by my boy Rhymin&rsquo; Simon. This song is really hard for me, but it&rsquo;s so satisfying to play.</p><h2 id=the-method>The Method</h2><p>I usually end up using tabs or YouTube videos to learn the songs, but I always spend at least a few minutes trying to figure it out by ear first. I usually end up with something vaguely resembling at least part of the song. Then I look up live performances of the songs, and try to figure it out by looking at their hands. Then if I&rsquo;m still stuck, I look up the tabs like a dang scrub.</p><p>Eventually I would also like to do some more rudimental practice that is not just learning songs. One thing I miss about Tabla is the strict practice routine, in which I would practice a short movement thousands of times in a row to build stamina. But I haven&rsquo;t really found a book or anything with these types of exercises that interests me, so I&rsquo;m just going to stick with songs for now.</p><h2 id=the-goal>The Goal</h2><p>The concrete goal is to know 12 songs top-to-bottom in 2023. That is, I can play along with the entire track. Right now I can probably do this with 3-4.</p><p>I guess the goal-behind-the-goal is to open another creative outlet for myself. Since my band broke up just before the pandemic, pretty much my only creative outlet has been programming. Eventually I would also like to get to a place where I could write my own songs. This style of music that I&rsquo;ve been learning feels very accessible in terms of songwriting, because they often have really simple structures and lyrics. I&rsquo;m hoping the more songs I learn, the more instincts I&rsquo;ll build up for chord progressions and things like that, and writing songs will come a little more naturally than it does now (that is, not at all). Or maybe I will just learn a bunch of other people&rsquo;s songs! That&rsquo;s fine too!</p><p>Bye!</p><a href=/>>> Home</a></main></div><footer><script>(function(){function n(e){var t,n,o,s=document.getElementsByTagName(e);for(n=0;n<s.length;n++)if(o=s[n],t=o.parentElement,t.childNodes.length===1){if(t.nodeName==="A"&&(t=t.parentElement,t.childNodes.length!=1))continue;t.nodeName==="P"&&(t.style.textAlign="center")}}for(var t=["img","embed","object"],e=0;e<t.length;e++)n(t[e])})()</script><hr><a href=https://github.com/alexgenco>GitHub</a> |
